Introduction Nowadays people pay a very steep price for mobility\&. In Europe alone around 40,000 people die on the roads every year\&. [ ] Many of the fatalities are not only caused by the crashes themselves, but by the time it takes for help to arrive\&. The first problem is that someone has to notify the authorities\&. More often than not the involved people are incapacitated and therefore incapable of doing this, so a third party has to do this\&. Time is wasted\&. Next problem arises when the emergency operator needs to collect the required information; it can be challenging for the operator to retrieve the information from a random caller\&. A protocol is needed\&. Lastly, the operator needs to dispatch the proper emergency response\&. A pan-European project called HeERO [ ], addresses an in-vehicle emergency call services based on the common European Emergency number, 112\&. HeERO is a group of European pilots who develop, implement and tests the infrastructure and standards\&. This becomes both the service and an IVS (In-Vehicle System) called eCall\&. At this moment HeERO is in the final stage of phase 2, where Denmark is one out of 15 countries involved in testing and validating the standards in real conditions\&. eCall addresses standards for third parties as well, but as HeERO project is not yet completed, things might change and some are still undefined\&. The 13th of June 2013 the EU passed a legislation that will ensure that from October 2015 all new passenger cars and light duty vehicles will be fitted with eCall\&.[ ] The IVS in this project will make it possible for people with pre-2015 cars to have the same opportunity and the same safety net as eCall provides with an aftermarket solution\&.
