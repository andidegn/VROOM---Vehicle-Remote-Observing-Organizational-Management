@section Introduction
@subsection Background
Nowadays people pay a very steep price for mobility. In Europe alone around 40,000 people die on the roads every year. [ ] Many of the fatalities are not only caused by the crashes themselves, but by the time it takes for help to arrive.
The first problem is that someone has to notify the authorities. More often than not the involved people are incapacitated and therefore incapable of doing this, so a third party has to do this. Time is wasted.
Next problem arises when the emergency operator needs to collect the required information; it can be challenging for the operator to retrieve the information from a random caller. A protocol is needed. Lastly, the operator needs to dispatch the proper emergency response.
A pan-European project called HeERO [ ], addresses an in-vehicle emergency call services based on the common European Emergency number, 112. HeERO is a group of European pilots who develop, implement and tests the infrastructure and standards. This becomes both the service and an IVS (In-Vehicle System) called eCall. At this moment HeERO is in the final stage of phase 2, where Denmark is one out of 15 countries involved in testing and validating the standards in real conditions. eCall addresses standards for third parties as well, but as HeERO project is not yet completed, things might change and some are still undefined.
The 13th of June 2013 the EU passed a legislation that will ensure that from October 2015 all new passenger cars and light duty vehicles will be fitted with eCall.[ ]
The IVS in this project will make it possible for people with pre-2015 cars to have the same opportunity and the same safety net as eCall provides with an aftermarket solution.

@section Changelog


=====================================
Version 0.163 - 2014/12/03 by Kenneth
=====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Added functions in timer.c to store interrupt flag registers and pause all timers and then restore the registers when resuming
- Moved recording of optional data values (acceleration and temperature) to MSD optional data function, as it is redundant 
  to calculate everytime it checks for accidents.
- Added module test for Car Panel: test_module_car_panel
- Minor (renaming of local variable) bug fixed in SPI driver

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Fixed bug in starting timer when an automatically accident has triggered
- MSD version 2: Changed structure of encoding optional data, so that only values is sent
- Added check for emmergency flags, when setting the status LED on car panel. This is done so that it lights up red while sending
  and green when it is done sending.
- Renamed UnitTest to test_unit
- Discarded unit test implementation for MSD as all the functions to set MSD are static

Version 0.06b - 2014/09/17 by Andi & Kenneth
============================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Improved sensor_scheduler to work autonomously from the main program using a timer and a 
   state-machine
- Updated main to work properly with analysis tool by sending accelerometer data at a working
   rate for analysis to be conducted in real-time without any latency. Test was conducted at 
   ~110Hz

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- fixed minor errors

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check on usart0-1, accelerometer, btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane
- missing commenting in btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane



=================================
Version 0.06 - 2014/09/16 by Andi
=================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Improvements in usart0-1:
	- USART_CHAR_SIZE enum changed and switch-case added in usartN_setup_async(...) function
	  as the identifier in USART_8_BIT and USART_9_BIT was the same
	- Added "+0.5F" to the CALC_UBRRn macro to make sure it rounds off rather than truncating
	- Changed sending functionality to use an ISR instead of waiting for empty transmition
	  register
	- Added a local buffer for transmit data to accommodate transmission of strings. It is 
	  possible to keep adding to this buffer witout loss of data if the buffer is not empty at
	  the time of transmission
	- "operational_mode" bit(s) are no longer being written to UCSRnC register as synchronous		  
	  and master SPI modes are not implemented
	- Name changed to UART as only the asynchronous modes are implemented
- Updated main to work properly with analysis tool

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- fixed minor errors

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check on usart0-1, accelerometer, btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane
- missing commenting in btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane



=================================
Version 0.05 - 2014/09/15 by Andi
=================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- added usart driver for USART0 and USART1
- re-added state machine in accelerometer and tc72 to avoid return of garbage data in the callback    
   routine
- setup usart transmission for testing with pc. it sends the accelerometer data
- re-written the accelerometer driver to be able to take setup parameters
- added LED driver for LEDs on aircraft on PORTB
- added LED and switch driver for the LCD board on PORTK (no available ISR for rotary encoder)
- added memory map file with port/pin information from all drivers
- completed doxygen documentation in usart0-1 and accelerometer
- updated main to include tests

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- fixed minor errors

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check on usart0-1, accelerometer, btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane
- missing commenting in btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane



====================================
Version 0.04 - 2014/09/11 by Kenneth
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Added a structure with doxygen documentation of the accident report 
   according to eCall and EN 15722 standards for MSD.

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Clean up in multiple files (mostly in comments)

ToDo
----	
 
 

=====================================
Version 0.031 - 2014/09/08 by Kenneth
=====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Added the Unit Test, which was missing in v0.03 and added the test in main

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Fixed comments style in SPI and Accelerometer driver (/** */ instead of //)

ToDo
----	
- Add state machine for call back in acc and tc72 

Note
----
- sprintf and printf have a huge overhead and are not recommended in embedded systems.
 
 

=================================
Version 0.03 - 2014/09/05 by Andi
=================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Completed doxygen documentation in spi and acc driver
- Added sensors_init() function in sensor_scheduler 
- Updated sensor_scheduler to work with current content
- Added scheduler_release() call in the tc72 and acc callback driver to accomodate for the
   sequential sensors read structure
- Defined scheduler delay for control of the reading period
 
Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Changed the structure of the SPI driver to make it work properly
- Assembled everything in a fresh project to fix unknown accelerometer data error
- Fixed error where array went out of scope in tc72 driver under setup (moved array
   decleration out of the function). Was causing corrupt memory
- Renamed collect_sensors_sata to sensor_scheduler
- Renamed function read_sensors() to scheduler_release() as it's not being called from the
   drivers callback functions when they are done reading
- Cleaned up drivers in general
 
ToDo
----	
- Minor ajustments might still be needed in multiple files
- Missing documentation in some files



====================================
Version 0.02 - 2014/09/05 by Kenneth
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- unit test included for tc72 (use #define UNIT_TEST to run test)
- tc72 pass MISRA standards, except violation on some rules when calculating temperature
 
Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Fixed temperature conversion so that negative values is represented correctly 

ToDo
----	
- MISRA not testet for SPI and timer

 
 
====================================
Version 0.01 - 2014/09/03 by Kenneth
====================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- First working version of tc72 driver with shared SPI and timer
 
Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------

ToDo
----	
- Needs to be checked for MISRA standards
