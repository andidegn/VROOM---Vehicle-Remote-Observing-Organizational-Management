@section Introduction
@subsection Background
Nowadays people pay a very steep price for mobility. In Europe alone around 40,000 people die on the roads every year. Many of the fatalities are not only caused by the crashes themselves, but by the time it takes for help to arrive. 
The first problem is that someone has to notify the authorities. More often than not the involved people are incapacitated and therefore incapable of doing this, so a third party has to do this. Time is wasted. 
Next problem arises when the emergency operator needs to collect the required information; it can be challenging for the operator to retrieve the information from a random caller. A protocol is needed. Lastly, the operator needs to dispatch the proper emergency response. 
A pan-European project called HeERO, addresses an in-vehicle emergency call services based on the common European Emergency number, 112. HeERO is a group of European pilots who develop, implement and tests the infrastructure and standards. This becomes both the service and an IVS (In-Vehicle System) called eCall. At this moment HeERO is in the final stage of phase 2, where Denmark is one out of 15 countries involved in testing and validating the standards in real conditions. eCall addresses standards for third parties as well, but as HeERO project is not yet completed, things might change and some are still undefined. 
December 4th 2014 the EU parliament passed a legislation that will ensure that from Marts 31st 2018 all new passenger cars and light duty vehicles will be fitted with eCall.
The IVS in this project will make it possible for people with pre-2018 cars to have the same opportunity and the same safety net as eCall provides with an aftermarket solution.

Version 0.201 - 2014/12/03 by Kenneth
=====================================

- Design and structure changes: 
   + Added new folder "application" which holds the scheduler.h / scheduler.c, timer.c / timer.h, 
     run.c and vroom_config.h. 
   + Added scheduler_pause();, scheduler_resume(bool __clear_TIFR); and scheduler_halt(); functions in scheduler.c
- Cleaned for unused includes

==================================
Version 0.200 - 2014/12/03 by Andi
==================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Changed sensor_scheduler to scheduler.h/ scheduler.c so that it is the scheduler for the whole system
- Added detection logic to scheduler.c
- Added solicited CREG check to _wait_for_connection function to make sure system does not freeze if an unsolicited
   CREG command should be missed

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Fixed unstability in communication with sim908 module by pausing scheduler timer in the _SIM908_callback function
   and clearing the _rx_response_length, _CR_counter and _LF_counter before each command is sent.
   This seems to have fixed most, if not all, communication problems and the system is now running stable at a frq of 
   1KHz on the scheduler timer with a system load around 50%
- !note CREG unsolicited response and Call Ready sometimes still miss at 1KHz

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- Fixed bug in starting timer when an automatically accident has triggered
