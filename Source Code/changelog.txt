Version 0.06b - 2014/09/17 by Andi & Kenneth
============================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------

  state-machine
- Updated main to work properly with analysis tool by sending accelerometer data at a working
  rate for analysis to be conducted in real-time without any latency. Test was conducted at 
  ~110Hz

-------------------
- fixed minor errors

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check on usart0-1, accelerometer, btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane

=================================
Version 0.06 - 2014/09/16 by Andi
=================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
- Improvements in usart0-1:
	- USART_CHAR_SIZE enum changed and switch-case added in usartN_setup_async(...) function
	  as the identifier in USART_8_BIT and USART_9_BIT was the same
	- Added "+0.5F" to the CALC_UBRRn macro to make sure it rounds off rather than truncating
	- Changed sending functionality to use an ISR instead of waiting for empty transmition
	  register
	- Added a local buffer for transmit data to accommodate transmission of strings. It is 
	  possible to keep adding to this buffer witout loss of data if the buffer is not empty at
	  the time of transmission
	- "operational_mode" bit(s) are no longer being written to UCSRnC register as synchronous		  
	  and master SPI modes are not implemented
	- Name changed to UART as only the asynchronous modes are implemented
- Updated main to work properly with analysis tool

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
- fixed minor errors

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check on usart0-1, accelerometer, btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane
- missing commenting in btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane



=================================

  routine
- setup usart transmission for testing with pc. it sends the accelerometer data
- re-written the accelerometer driver to be able to take setup parameters
- added LED driver for LEDs on aircraft on PORTB
- added LED and switch driver for the LCD board on PORTK (no available ISR for rotary encoder)
- added memory map file with port/pin information from all drivers
- completed doxygen documentation in usart0-1 and accelerometer

Note
----
- sprintf and printf have a huge overhead and are not recommended in embedded systems.

   decleration out of the function). Was causing corrupt memory
- Renamed collect_sensors_sata to sensor_scheduler
- Renamed function read_sensors() to scheduler_release() as it's not being called from the
   drivers callback functions when they are done reading
