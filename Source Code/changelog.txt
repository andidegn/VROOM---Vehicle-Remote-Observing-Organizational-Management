Version 0.104 - 2014/11/10 by Kenneth
===================================
New Features, Improvements
--------------------------
* Implemented functions to convert (a hardcoded) GPS response into MSD data structure.

Fixed Bugs, Changes
-------------------
* Fixed bug in function for calculating course
* Changed latitude/longitude function so that it stores the data in milliarcseconds

ToDo
----	
- MISRA check all files
- missing commenting in btn_led_lcd and led_on_plane
- Split up module test in individual file, instead of having it in main
- Needs to store the GPS response somehow
- Needs to check for CREG 
- INFO: System needs to send data before making the phone call as the system is busy when calling
